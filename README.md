## Welcome to My Machine Learning Projects

This repo is where I'm learning and applying machine learning. Here I intend to share supervised models like classification and regression, unsupervised techniques like clustering and generative modeling and later image recognition.

Iâ€™m exploring image recognition, structured data workflows, and building pipelines that are reproducible and scalable.
Everything is designed to be modular and cloud-ready.
