## Welcome to My Machine Learning Projects

Hi, I'm Harrison — a physics graduate and AWS-certified ML engineer seeking to build my skills through hands on projects. This repo is my sandbox for learning, experimenting, and sharing. I'm always working on something new, whether it's predicting NBA player performance, modeling athletic potential, or exploring physics-inspired systems.

My goal is to cover a wide range of machine learning algorithms and frameworks — from tree-based models to deep learning — while gradually moving more of my workflows to the cloud using AWS services like SageMaker, S3, and Lambda. 

I’m constantly learning and refining my skills, and I welcome any feedback, ideas, or collaboration. If you're into data, sports, science, or just curious about how machine learning can be applied in thoughtful ways, I’d love for you to explore what I’m building.
